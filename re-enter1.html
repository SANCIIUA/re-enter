    I walk through the deluge of small kittens back into my room. <br>
    I grab my glasses, put them on and walk back to the living room. <br>
    Look around. I think I have everything this time, so I leave the apartment once again. Turning the key within the lock, I secure the door. <br>
    I take two steps and realize... I've left my water bottle
